##  Start-up Success Analysis

---

###  Project Proposal
The aim of this project is to analyze which factors influence the success of start-ups in their early years. The focus is on founder experience, team size, and country-level economic indicators, and how these variables relate to start-up success.

## Motivation
The motivation of this project comes from my personal interest in entrepreneurship. Moreover, I want to establish a startup myself in the future.
The number of start-ups increasing day by day worldwide. Even though the number increases, approximately 90% of start-ups fail within their first three years. But not all of these fail from bad ideas. There are lots of factors like team imbalance, poor funding etc. 
Understanding these factors not only shows entrepreneurs what to pay attention to but also gives investors perspective on which ventures to invest in.

###  Research Question
What factors contribute to early start-up success, and how do founder, team, and country-level characteristics affect outcomes?

### Objectives
- Identify possible variables that influence start-up success  
- Collect relevant data from multiple sources  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Perform hypothesis testing to evaluate relationships  
- Identify which factors have the strongest impact

### Hypotheses
1. Higher initial funding increases the likelihood of start-up success.  
2. Start-ups with 2–3 founders perform better than solo founders.  
3. Countries with higher GDP growth have more successful start-ups.  
4. High competition levels in a sector reduce success probability.  
5. Founder experience has a significant positive correlation with success.

### Methodology Overview
- Collect start-up-level data (founding year, founders, funding, status).  
- Gather macro-level indicators (GDP growth, R&D expenditure, patents).  
- Merge datasets using country and year information.  
- Conduct EDA (summary statistics, plots, correlations).  
- Run hypothesis tests (t-tests, chi-square tests, regression models).

### Expected Outcome
The project will highlight which factors are most associated with start-up success and how founder, team, and economic conditions interact to influence outcomes.ol edin.
