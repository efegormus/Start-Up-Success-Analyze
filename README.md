##  Start-up Success Analysis

###  Project Proposal
The aim of this project is to analyze which factors influence the success of start-ups in their early years. The focus is on founder experience, team size, and country-level economic indicators, and how these variables relate to start-up success.

###  Research Question
What factors contribute to early start-up success, and how do founder, team, and country-level characteristics affect outcomes?

### Objectives
- Identify possible variables that influence start-up success  
- Collect relevant data from multiple sources  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Perform hypothesis testing to evaluate relationships  
- Identify which factors have the strongest impact

### Hypotheses
1. Higher initial funding increases the likelihood of start-up success.  
2. Start-ups with 2–3 founders perform better than solo founders.  
3. Countries with higher GDP growth have more successful start-ups.  
4. High competition levels in a sector reduce success probability.  
5. Founder experience has a significant positive correlation with success.

### Methodology Overview
- Collect start-up-level data (founding year, founders, funding, status).  
- Gather macro-level indicators (GDP growth, R&D expenditure, patents).  
- Merge datasets using country and year information.  
- Conduct EDA (summary statistics, plots, correlations).  
- Run hypothesis tests (t-tests, chi-square tests, regression models).

### Expected Outcome
The project will highlight which factors are most associated with start-up success and how founder, team, and economic conditions interact to influence outcomes.
